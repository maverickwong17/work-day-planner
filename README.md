## Description 

## [Deployed Link](https://maverickwong17.github.io/work-day-planner/).

This application is a daily work planner. It will update to show the current day, date, and time. The text blocks will save locally and persist on refresh, as well as color code based on the time.(Grey for past, red for present, green for future timeslots). This is my first implementation of bootstrap, jquery, and other 3rd party web APIs.
